# Homework 2: Music Visualizer
Your second mission is designing music visualizers that convert music audio to a colorful animation. The start-up code is provided so that you can easily work on it. 

## Step #1 
In the first example, you are going to visualize 10 subbands levels as a set of neighboring level meters, which is typical in audio EQ systems. In order to implement it, you need to write the followings by filling out the empty part of the start-up code:

- Summarizing FFT spectrum to 10 subbands over frequency
- Adding an envelope follower to each subband level 

The envelope follower takes the input level when the input level is greater than the tracked level. However, when the input level is less than the tracked level, the  envelope follower takes decayed value from the tracked level by a factor of 0.95 or so. 

Note that you shohuld first change the filenames from "MusicVisualizer_startup.js" to "MusicVisualizer.js" and "octave_band_startup.js" to "octave_band.js".  


## Step #2
Write a visualiation function that takes the 10-subband levels and renders an interesting animation. Regarding drawing, you can refer to the following tutorials:
